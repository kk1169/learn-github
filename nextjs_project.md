# NEXTJS TUTORIALS

Next.js is a popular open-source JavaScript framework that is used for building server-side rendered (SSR) and statically generated React applications. It is built on top of React and offers many features and optimizations for creating fast and efficient web applications.

Next.js provides a wide range of benefits, including:

1. Server-side rendering (SSR): Next.js can render the initial page on the server-side, which improves the application's performance and SEO.
2. Static site generation (SSG): It allows you to pre-render pages at build time, which can lead to even faster loading times and better SEO.
3. Automatic code splitting: Next.js automatically splits your JavaScript code into smaller chunks, which are loaded on-demand, reducing the initial loading time of your application.
4. Hot module replacement: Next.js provides a great development experience by supporting hot module replacement, allowing you to see changes without needing to manually refresh the page during development.
5. Built-in CSS and SASS support: Next.js comes with built-in support for importing CSS and SASS modules, making it easy to manage styles within your components.
6. API routes: It allows you to create API endpoints directly within your Next.js application, enabling serverless functions or server-side logic.
7. TypeScript support: Next.js has excellent TypeScript integration, allowing developers to write type-safe applications.
8. Fast refresh: Next.js has a fast refresh feature, which speeds up development by maintaining the state of your React components while modifying the code.

Since the web development landscape is constantly evolving, there might have been updates and improvements to Next.js beyond my last update. I recommend visiting the official Next.js website or their GitHub repository for the most up-to-date information and documentation.

## Routing
In Next.js, routing is handled through a file-based system, which means that each page in your application is represented by a separate file in the "pages" directory. The routing is automatic and follows the directory structure. Here's a basic explanation of how routing works in Next.js:

1. File-Based Routing: Inside your Next.js project, you will find a "pages" directory. Each file inside this directory represents a specific route in your application. For example:
    * pages/index.js maps to the root route ("/")
    * pages/about.js maps to "/about"
    * pages/contact.js maps to "/contact"
  
2. Nested Routes: If you create a directory inside the "pages" directory, Next.js will automatically treat it as a nested route. For example:

pages/products/index.js maps to "/products"
pages/products/item.js maps to "/products/item"

3. Dynamic Routes: You can create dynamic routes by using brackets [] in the file name. Anything inside brackets is considered a dynamic parameter. For example:

pages/posts/[id].js maps to "/posts/1", "/posts/2", etc.
pages/users/[username].js maps to "/users/john", "/users/susan", etc.
Query Parameters: You can also handle query parameters by using the "query" object from the "useRouter" hook. For example:

pages/search.js maps to "/search?q=keyword". You can access the "q" parameter using the "query" object.

3. Link Component: To navigate between pages, you should use the Link component from "next/link" instead of regular anchor tags. This ensures that the routing works smoothly and does not perform a full-page reload.
